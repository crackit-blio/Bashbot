# URL Visiting Bot

## Overview

This Bash script allows you to visit a specified URL using various proxies and user agents. It automates the process of making HTTP requests to a target URL using different IP addresses and user agents.

## Requirements

- **Termux** (or any Linux-like environment)
- **curl** command-line tool

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/URL-Visiting-Bot.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the directory**:

   ```bash
   cd URL-Visiting-Bot
   ```

3. **Edit the script** (`visit_urls.sh`) to include your desired URL and adjust other parameters if needed.

4. **Make the script executable**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x visit_urls.sh
   ```

5. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   ./visit_urls.sh
   ```

## Configuration

- **URL:** Modify the `URL` variable in the script to specify the target URL.
- **Proxies:** Update the `PROXY_LIST` variable in the script with your list of proxies in the format `"IP:PORT"`.
- **User Agents:** Adjust the `USER_AGENTS` array in the script with your preferred user agent strings.

## Disclaimer

Ensure that you have the legal authority to use the provided proxies and that your actions comply with the terms of service of the target website. Usage of proxies without proper authorization may lead to legal consequences.
